    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
      William Henry Gates III, known as Bill Gates, was born on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington. Gates developed an interest in computing at a young age, writing his first software program at 13. In 1975, he co-founded Microsoft with his childhood friend Paul Allen. Microsoft revolutionized personal computing by developing the MS-DOS operating system and later Windows. Gates served as Microsoft's CEO until 2000, then as Chairman and Chief Software Architect. He is credited with being a pivotal figure in the personal computer revolution of the 20th century. Gates became one of the world's wealthiest individuals, topping the Forbes list of billionaires multiple times. In 2008, he transitioned to a part-time role at Microsoft to focus on the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The foundation, co-chaired with his then-wife Melinda, focuses on global health, education, and poverty eradication. Gates continues to be a leading figure in philanthropy, advocating for solutions to global challenges.
